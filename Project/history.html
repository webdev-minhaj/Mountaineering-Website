                <h1>Early Mountaineering</h1>
                <p>Humans have been present in mountains since prehistory. The remains of Ötzi, who lived in the 4th
                    millennium BC, were found in a glacier in the Ötztal Alps.[10] However, the highest mountains were
                    rarely visited early on, and were often associated with supernatural or religious concepts.[11]
                    Nonetheless, there are many documented examples of people climbing mountains prior to the formal
                    development of the sport in the 19th century, although many of these stories are sometimes
                    considered fictional or legendary.[citation needed]

                    The famous poet Petrarch describes his 26 April 1336 ascent of Mount Ventoux (1,912 m (6,273 ft)) in
                    one of his epistolae familiares, claiming to be inspired by Philip V of Macedon's ascent of Mount
                    Haemo.[12][13]

                    For most of antiquity, climbing mountains was a practical or symbolic activity, usually undertaken
                    for economic, political, or religious purposes. A commonly cited example is the 1492 ascent of Mont
                    Aiguille (2,085 m (6,841 ft)) by Antoine de Ville, a French military officer and lord of Domjulien
                    and Beaupré.[13]

                    In the Andes, around the late 1400s and early 1500s many ascents were made of extremely high peaks
                    by the Incas and their subjects. The highest they are known for certain to have climbed is 6739m at
                    the summit of Volcan Llullaillaco.[14]</p>

            <h1>The Enlightenment and the Golden Age of Alpinism</h1>
            <p>The Age of Enlightenment and the Romantic era marked a change of attitudes towards high mountains. In 1757 Swiss scientist Horace-Bénédict de Saussure made the first of several unsuccessful attempts on Mont Blanc in France. He then offered a reward to anyone who could climb the mountain, which was claimed in 1786 by Jacques Balmat and Michel-Gabriel Paccard. The climb is usually considered an epochal event in the history of mountaineering, a symbolic mark of the birth of the sport.[11][13]

                By the early 19th century, many of the alpine peaks were reached, including the Grossglockner in 1800, the Ortler in 1804, the Jungfrau in 1811, the Finsteraarhorn in 1812, and the Breithorn in 1813.[11] In 1808, Marie Paradis became the first woman to climb Mont Blanc, followed in 1838 by Henriette d'Angeville.[15]</p>

    <h1>Expansion around the world</h1>
    <p>In the 19th century, the focus of mountaineering turned towards mountains beyond the Alps, and by the turn of the 20th century, mountaineering had acquired a more international flavour.[22]

        In 1897 Mount Saint Elias (18,008 ft (5,489 m)) on the Alaska-Yukon border was summitted by the Duke of the Abruzzi and party.[23] In 1879–1880 the exploration of the highest Andes in South America began when English mountaineer Edward Whymper climbed Chimborazo (20,549 ft (6,263 m)) and explored the mountains of Ecuador.[24] It took until the late 19th century for European explorers to penetrate Africa. Mount Kilimanjaro in Africa was climbed in 1889 by Austrian mountaineer Ludwig Purtscheller and German geologist Hans Meyer, Mount Kenya in 1899 by Halford Mackinder.[25]</p>

            Long the domain of the wealthy elite and their agents, the emergence of the middle-class in the 19th and 20th centuries has resulted in mass interest in mountaineering. It became a popular pastime and hobby of many people.[11] Some have to come to criticize the sport as becoming too much of a tourist activity.[29]
